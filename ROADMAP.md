# Roadmap

Mark all activities with a ✅ once complete.

## Phase 1 (io_uring)

- Replace recvmmsg with io_uring for:
    - 80-95% syscall reduction
    - Zero-copy operations
    - 50-150% throughput improvement

## Phase 2 Security Hardening

- Rate limiting per client IP.
- Connection tracking and DoS prevention.
- Additional NIST control implementations.
- Web UI authentication (all endpoints are currently unauthenticated — any network client can upload, delete, mkdir, and read audit logs without credentials).
